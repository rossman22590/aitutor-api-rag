## Overview

AI Tutor RAG API is a cutting-edge solution designed to empower your AI applications with context-aware answers derived directly from your document storage. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, our API enhances AI responses by combining general AI capabilities with precise, context-specific information from your documents. Whether you're running an enterprise-level solution or a personal project, AI Tutor RAG API scales seamlessly to meet your needs.

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances AI responses by integrating relevant data directly from your documents. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained AI models, RAG dynamically searches your document repositories to fetch accurate and context-aware information. This allows your AI system to provide responses that are not only intelligent but also highly specific to your content.
